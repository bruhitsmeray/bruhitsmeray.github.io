                <h2>CATCHING UP (again)</h2>
                <p id="p0">So, it's been nearly 1 year since the last "catching up" and then I kinda ghosted this blog, so yeah... sorry about that. I'd like to talk about the blog design
                first. Some might say that the previous design looked better and it might be true, but now it's simpler. Anyway, this year I've worked at a few scripts and projects,
                let's get the scripts out of the way first.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>automatr:</h3>
                <p id="p0">automatr & cleanr are 2 powershell scripts for cleaning Windows and installing some essential (at least for me) apps. That's it, done. You can find it on GitHub.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Eutera 4.5:</h3>
                <p id="p0">Eutera 4.5 is an updated version of the Discord bot. Functionally it's not too different but it uses Discord.JS 13 and approaches some tasks differently from
                the previous versions. I might bring it back online at a later date.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Aleph:</h3>
                <p id="p0">Now let's get to the new stuff, Aleph is a project that I've been contributing to for the past few months, and it serves as a great basis for Decay and other
                future games. Aleph serves more as a compilation of code and blueprints. Helping any related development going forward. So that's pretty nice.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Decay:</h3>
                <p id="p0">Well this is an old-new project, started in 2019. Now it's using most of Aleph's code, if not improved a little to fit the needs of the game. Decay is still
                in early development, with a demo coming at a later date.</p>
                <br>
                <p id="p0">I think this is it for now, just wanted to keep you posted with progress on stuff.</p>

                <p id="p0">The new year I was talking about in my last post has nearly passed. New projects got borned and a new design for this blog got released. I'll follow up with another 
                post to talk about them. Eutera got updated too and might come back online in 2022. All things considered, this year was pretty good & I hope yours was just the same!</p>

                    <br>
                    <h3>GENERAL STUFF</h3>
                    <p id="p0">Hi there guys, so I haven't really worked on the website in the last few days and I probably won't for another few days. I'm trying to come up with a really nice
                        design for the site before getting back to work. Maybe this is also an excuse to play Cyberpunk 2077 a bit more. I love that game, it's everything that I expected
                        from it! Also, this is the first post that I write with the new keyboard and I fucking love it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>MUSIC & STREAMING</h3>
                    <p id="p0">Although I haven't worked on the website, I was thinking the way I wanted to handle livestreams. I love streaming on Twitch but it renders me unable to deliver a
                        smooth stream while making it look good, so I decided to start streaming on YouTube from now on, I'll make more details available soon. I also have an album in the
                        works, it's basically a compilation of every good song that I made fron 2019 to 2020. It contains 40 Minutes of good stuff and it will probably release on YouTube &
                        SoundCloud.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>LAST FEW WORDS</h3>
                    <p id="p0">2020 wasn't the best year ever, actually it really sucked. I couldn't write, work on my game or see my friends because of COVID and lack of inspiration. 
                        But I also learned some stuff about what I'm doing and about me, 2020 can't end any sooner, but I'm kinda scared about 2021 to be honest. Let's just hope it will
                        be better than this year was. See ya later my friends, stay safe!</p>

                        Well now all I gotta do is figure out how to make the custom cursor work. FUCK YOU CURSOR!</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>EDIT:</h3>
                    <p id="p0">I actually fucked the cursor. So I just grabbed a nice little cursor from the web and now it works. Coding go brrr!</p>

                    <p id="p0">I'm working on the design of this page and I kinda want a blog section. 
                    But I want to make this site to make a portofolio on it, so if any employer will see what I post I will probably loose my job before getting it!</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>EDIT:</h3>
                    <p id="p0">I actually did it. I'm gonna have to write my blogs inside the code for now but that's ok. I'm definitely not gonna get hired anywhere.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>EDIT 2:</h3>
                    <p id="p0">Ok, so the only problem now is that this blog section is kinda 'hacked' together and I kinda need to find a way to write new blogs easy. 
                    Because otherwise this will be a pain in the ass. The problem isn't really on writing the blog in-code but with the way that I will create new spaces for the new blog and that's already a problem. 
                    I could just clone properties of this space inside the style.css file but it's not really a good idea because the code will get very bloated very quickly that way.</p>
