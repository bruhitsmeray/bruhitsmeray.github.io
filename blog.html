                                    <br>This is me 15 minutes from NOW. Actually it's easier to do new spaces than I thought. Well now all I gotta do is figure out how to make the custom cursor work. FUCK YOU CURSOR!

                                    <br>I actually fucked the cursor. So I just grabbed a nice little cursor from the web and now it works. Coding go brrr!

                                <br>I'm working on the design of this page and I kinda want a blog section. But I want to make this site to make a portofolio on it, so if any employer will see what I post I will probably loose my job before getting it!

                                <br>I actually did it. I'm gonna have to write my blogs inside the code for now but that's ok. I'm definitely not gonna get hired anywhere.

                                <br>Ok, so the only problem now is that this blog section is kinda 'hacked' together and I kinda need to find a way to write new blogs easy. Because otherwise this will be a pain in the ass. The problem isn't really on writing the blog in-code but with the way that I will create new spaces for the new blog and that's already a problem. I could just clone properties of this space inside the style.css file but it's not really a good idea because the code will get very bloated very quickly that way.
